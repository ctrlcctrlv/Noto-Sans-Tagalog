# Noto Sans Tagalog v3.0

Noto Sans Tagalog, the Noto _baybayin_ font, as a variable font.

# Building

To build, you need:

* FontForge
* `fontmake`
* `ttfautohint`

With those installed and in your path, run `build.sh`.

This font is considered feature-complete, but should you find something missing, or a bug, which you wish to patch, feel free to submit a pull request; unlike many Noto fonts, this font is built entirely with free software, so contributing should be easier.
